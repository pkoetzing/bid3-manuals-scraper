- [x] A3: Check if manual_urls.json file exists with required URLs - ‚úÖ EXISTS
- [x] A4: Validate Python environment setup - ‚ùå DEPENDENCIES MISSING

### Phase B: Script Execution

- [ ] B1: Run scraper_fixed.py and capture error output
- [ ] B2: Analyze any runtime errors encountered
- [ ] B3: Identify root causes of errors

### Phase C: Error Resolution

- [ ] C1: Fix import or dependency issues
- [ ] C2: Fix file path or configuration issues
- [ ] C3: Fix authentication or web scraping issues
- [ ] C4: Fix any other runtime errors identified

### Phase D: Verification

- [ ] D1: Re-run the script to verify fixes
- [ ] D2: Ensure successful execution without errors
- [ ] D3: Validate that core functionality works as expected

- [x] C1: Define User Manual page URLs (8 pages)
- [x] C2: Define Technical Manual page URLs (14 pages)
- [x] C3: Implement page categorization logic (user-manual vs technical-manual)

### Phase D: Main Execution Logic

- [x] D1: Create main execution script
- [x] D2: Implement login flow
- [x] D3: Implement iterative download for all manual pages
- [x] D4: Implement progress tracking and logging
- [x] D5: Add error handling and retry logic

### Phase E: Testing and Validation

- [x] E1: Create test environment validation
- [x] E2: Test authentication flow
- [x] E3: Test single page download
- [x] E4: Test recursive link following
- [x] E5: Validate output file naming convention

Phase 2: Planning - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
Phase 3: Execution - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
